\section{Resolution}
\indent the first test of resolution was with a single-channel MCA
It was found that the NP7 detector had superior energy resolution than the Ortec detector. R

\section{Difference in Contacts}
\indent B and Li vs amorphous Ge

\section{Difference in Symmetry}
\indent 2 contact material vs 1 contact material

\section{Difference in Inter-Strip Spacing}
\indent .5 mm vs .25 mm

Effects showing electronic coupling speak to the detectors' inter-strip spacing. Plots of front-side energy vs back-side energy should show a 45$^{\circ}$ line
