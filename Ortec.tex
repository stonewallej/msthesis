\section{subsection title}
\indent mention where from

The Ortec Low Energy Photon Spectrometer detector (LEPS) is a square planar detector of high purity germanium measuring 92mm by 92mm with a 20mm thickness. It has 32 electrically segmented contacts;16 one each side. The two sets of contacts are orthogonal to eachother forming 256 pixels. The contacts have a 5mm pitch and a .5mm spacing.There is 2.25mm of Ge crystal on each edge that is not utilized. One set of contacts are made from implanted lithium and the other from boron using photolithography. 

The boron contacts have a thickness of ????? and are labeled B00-B15. These contacts make up the AC side of the LEPS detector and have a reverse bias of -1300V applied. Contacts on this side collect the positively-charged holes created when a gamma ray interacts with the crystal. Output appears as a negative pulse.
